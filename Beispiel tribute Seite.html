          >Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen "A. P. J." Abdul Kalam </a
        >(15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was the 11th President of India from
        2002 to 2007. A career scientist turned politician, Kalam was born and
        raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and studied physics and aerospace
        engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science
        administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
        Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
        was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military
        missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man
        of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
        vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,
        and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the
        first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

        Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the
        support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
        then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
        "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education,
        writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of
        several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
        civilian honour.

        While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management
        Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27
        July 2015, aged 83. Thousands including national-level dignitaries
        attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameshwaram, where
        he was buried with full state honours
      </p>

      <p>
        In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a
        bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He
        spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics. After completing his
        education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam
        went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then
        affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in
        physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace
        engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While Kalam was working
        on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of
        progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was
        finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing
        the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and
        asking you to meet a difficult deadline". He narrowly missed achieving
        his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers,
        and only eight positions were available in the IAF.
